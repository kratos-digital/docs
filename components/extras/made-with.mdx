You can render the component like this:

```javascript
<MadeWith href="https://butchr.dev">Made with Butchr</MadeWith>
```

To add external link, pass the prop external with the component:

```javascript
<MadeWith href="https://butchr.dev" external>
  Made with Butchr
</MadeWith>
```

You can also change the position of component to display it left, right (default) or center:

```javascript
<MadeWith href="https://butchr.dev" external position="center">
  Made with Butchr
</MadeWith>
```
