## Pricing component

To render pricing tables you can use the main component `resources/js/Components/Sections/Pricing/Pricing.vue`, which will handle the data in the background.

The `payment` prop is fetched from `HomepageController` to `resources/js/Pages/Index.vue` page (view file for index page aka homepage).

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Default
<Pricing :data="payment" />
```

```javascript Auto-render
<Pricing :data="payment" variant="auto" />
```

</CodeGroup>

Auto variant will render pricing tables according to the number of plans. For one plan it will render **Single product table**, for two plans **Dual products table** and for 3 or more **Default pricing tables**.

Default variant will always render **Default pricing tables** regardless of number of plans.

## Pricing table components

You can also use specific components, instead of the main `Pricing` component. Just follow the links below to see how.
