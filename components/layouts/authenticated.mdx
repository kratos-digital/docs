## User object

If you need to use User object in your components, you can get it quickly from layout.

```javascript
<AuthenticatedLayout #default="{ user }">
    {{ user }}
</AuthenticatedLayout>
```

You can see the the real example in `modules/Helpdesk/resources/js/Pages/Index.vue`

Usually you could get User object this way:

```javascript
const user = computed(() => usePage().props.auth.user);
```
