## Animations

Some components have included animations on scroll, hover or click, such as featured image, icons in feature cards, numbers in stats, testimonials, etc.

If you want to disable animations globally, set `VITE_ANIMATIONS` in `.env` file to empty.

You can also pass `animate` property to each of those components to enable or disable animations per component. You can find more info in docs for each of those components.

## Blurred backdrop

Dialogs, sheets and drawers have backdrop that blurs the content beneath it.

If you want to use only backdrop background color, without the blur, set `VITE_BACKDROP_BLUR` in `.env` file to `backdrop-blur-none`.

If you want to use different blur value, set `VITE_BACKDROP_BLUR` in `.env` file to one of available [classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-blur). Default value is `backdrop-blur-sm`.

If your new class is not working, make sure to safelist the class in `tailwind.config.js` under `safelist` array.

## Tooltips

Shadcn-vue Tooltip component: https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/tooltip.html

To render tooltip just follow the [docs](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/tooltip.html#usage) or search for `ToolTipProvider` in the source code.

There is a minor `bug` when using tooltips:

If you have an element with tooltip inside your `popover`, `dialog`, `dropdown` or any similar element with **open and close states**, the first tooltip will be rendered when you open it.

Use this code to prevent tooltip auto-show (check [radix-vue docs](https://www.radix-vue.com/overview/getting-started.html) for exact names)

```javascript
<PopoverContent @open-auto-focus="(e: Event) => e.preventDefault()">
</PopoverContent>
```

You can find such example in `modules/Roadmap/resources/js/Pages/Show.vue`.

## Dialogs

In some cases we are required to manipulate dialog states.

To make it seemless there is composable `resources/js/composable/useDialog.ts` which you can use to control dialog states.

<Info>
  It can be used with any component with open/close state such as `Dialog`,
  `AlertDialog`, `Popover`, `Sheet`, etc.
</Info>

### How to use it?

Import the composable:

```javascript
import { dialogState } from "@/composable/useDialog";

const { isOpen, openDialog, closeDialog } = dialogState();
```

Or just import the one you will use:

```javascript
import { dialogState } from "@/composable/useDialog";

const { isOpen } = dialogState();
```

`isOpen` presents dialog state which tells you if dialog is open (_true_) or closed (_false_).

`openDialog` and `closeDialog` are functions to open or close the dialog.

Then you can use it to set the dialog's v-model:

```javascript
<Dialog v-model:open="isOpen"></Dialog>
```

Or to close the dialog on form success:

```javascript
const submit = () => {
  form.post(route("do-something"), {
    preserveScroll: true,
    onSuccess: () => {
      closeDialog();
      form.reset();
    },
  });
};
```

You can also use it when you have multiple dialogs on one page:

```javascript
const { isOpen: isOpenFoo, closeDialog: closeDialogFoo } = dialogState();
const { isOpen: isOpenBar, closeDialog: closeDialogBar } = dialogState();

<Dialog v-model:open="isOpenFoo">Foo dialog content</Dialog>
<Dialog v-model:open="isOpenBar">Bar dialog content</Dialog>
```
