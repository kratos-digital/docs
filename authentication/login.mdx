## Introduction

**{appName}** offers a complete authentication system out of the box. It is based on Laravel authentication system with some additions.

## Update Password Rules

Go to `HandleInertiaRequests.php`, under `share` method and update password rules for your app.

By default, for production environment, password should be at least **8** characters long with at least **one uppercase letter**, **one lowercase letter**, **one number**, **one symbol**, and **not compromised** in a public password data breach leak. You can find all the available rules [here](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/validation#validating-passwords).

For all other environments (development, testing, staging) it should be only **4** characters long without any other restrictions.

```php
Password::defaults(function () {
    return $this->app->isProduction()
        ? Password::min(8)
            ->mixedCase()
            ->numbers()
            ->symbols()
            ->uncompromised()
        : Password::min(4);
});
```

## Layout

Authentication system consist of several components:

- Login `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Login.vue`
- Register `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Register.vue`
- Email verification `resources/js/Pages/Auth/VerifyEmail.vue`
- Forgot password `resources/js/Pages/Auth/ForgotPassword.vue`
- Password reset `resources/js/Pages/Auth/ResetPassword.vue`

Each component is wrapped in `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Partials/Wrapper.vue` where you can customize the layout.

<Info>You can change the layout without updating the code.</Info>

Open your `.env` file and set `AUTH_FORM_LAYOUT` to `centered`, `left` or `right`.<br/ >
Default layout is `centered`.

**Centered** layout displays just the form in the center of the page.

**Left** and **right** layout displays the form on the left or right side, along with some content and background image.

By default, placeholder image is used as the background image. You can easily update the image, remove it, change background color, add background gradient, etc. Just go to the `Wrapper.vue` component and search for `bg-`.

### Header

Wrapper accepts the `header` property. Header for login and register forms can be updated in `AuthenticatedSessionController` and `RegisteredUserController` controllers under method `header()`.

You can pass an empty array if you don't want to display header and description, or you can remove the description and display the title only.

Headers for other authentication forms are passed as `header` property in their controllers.

### Labels

By default, form input labels are displayed above the input fields. If you want to hide labels, set `AUTH_FORM_SHOW_LABELS` to `false` in your `.env` file.

### Show/hide password

To enable password visibility toggle, pass the prop `toggleable` to `Input` component.

```javascript
<Input type="password" v-model="form.password" required toggleable />
```

### Social providers position

By default, social providers for login and registration are displayed below other input fields. To display them at the top, set `AUTH_FORM_SOCIAL_PROVIDERS_POSITION` to `top` in your `.env` file.
