Feature is provided by [Spatie Laravel Permission package](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/introduction).

## Permissions

Itâ€™s recommended to define and create new permissions in enum file `app/Enums/Permission.php`. Enums are then used to seed roles and permissions via file `database/seeders/RoleAndPermissionSeeder.php`.

There is no UI in admin panel to create new permissions.

## Roles

Roles are just an easier way to organize types of users with a list of common permissions.

You can create new roles via admin panel and assign them existing permissions.

### Assign roles to Admin

When creating or updating Admin user you can also add non-related permissions along with the selected role, but you can't remove permissions from the role for specific user. Instead, you can just select permissions wihout the role.

## Policies

Permissions are usually used with Policies to authorize user actions such as viewing, creating, updating or deleting models. Policies are then used (usually) under form requests and controller methods.

Example to allow administrators to view users (authorize policy in controller method):

<CodeGroup>

```php UserPolicy.php
public function viewAny(Admin $user): bool
{
    // Allow admin with "view any users" permission to pass the authentication
    return $user->can(Permission::ViewAnyUsers->value);
}
```

```php UserController.php
public function index(): Response
{
    // Call the UserPolicy@viewAny method to check if user is authorized to view this page
    $this->authorize('viewAny', User::class);

    // Authorized...
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Example to allow administrators to update users (authorize policy in controller for GET and in form request for POST):

<CodeGroup>

```php UserPolicy.php
public function update(Admin $user): bool
{
    // Allow admin with "update users" permission to pass the authentication
    return $user->can(Permission::UpdateUsers->value);
}
```

```php UserController.php
public function edit(User $user): Response
{
    // Call the UserPolicy@update method to check if user is authorized to view this page
    $this->authorize('update', User::class);

    // Authorized...
}

public function update(UpdateUserRequest $request, User $user): RedirectResponse
{
    // Authorized...
}
```

```php UpdateUserRequest.php
public function authorize(): bool
{
    // Call the UserPolicy@update method to check if user is authorized to perform this action
    return $this->user()->can('update', User::class);
}
```

</CodeGroup>
