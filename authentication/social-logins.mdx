[Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/socialite) is package used to enable social media login.

## Configuration

Before using Socialite, you will need to add credentials for the OAuth providers your application utilizes. Typically, these credentials may be retrieved by creating a "developer application" within the dashboard of the service you will be authenticating with.

These credentials should be placed in `config/services.php` file.

## Providers

Socialite supports this list of providers:

- Facebook
- X
- LinkedIn
- Google
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- Slack

```php
'google' => [
    'client_id' => env('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'),
    'client_secret' => env('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'redirect' => '/auth/callback/google',
],
```

If you need other providers you should extend the package or implement another solution.
