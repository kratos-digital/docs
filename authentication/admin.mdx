## Introduction

**{appName}** offers a complete authentication system for Administrators out of the box. It is based on Laravel authentication system using `admin` guard.<br />
Users of application are authenticated via `web` guard.

### Model

Admin users are identified by `Admin` model.

### Admin panel

To access Admin panel go to URL `/admin`.<br />
You can change the URL path by adding `.env` variable `ADMIN_AREA_ROUTE_PREFIX`.

```bash
# /super-secret-area instead of /admin
ADMIN_AREA_ROUTE_PREFIX="super-secret-area"
```

## Create Super Admin

Open your terminal, run command `php artisan app:admin` and follow the steps to create new Super Admin.<br />
This command is useful to create new admins or to create your first admin if you won't use seeders to create it.

## Roles

By default, there are several predefined roles for Administrators.

You can delete all the roles and permissions in seeders if you don't need them. This is the case when you only need super admin users. However, there should be one role defined for super admins.

Visit `RoleAndPermissionSeeder.php` to update or delete them.

### Super Admin

Administrators with full access are identified by `Super Admin` role, which you can override by adding `.env` variable `SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE_NAME`.

<Warning>
  If you use default Seeder you should update the role name before running
  seeders.
</Warning>

```
SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE_NAME="God"
```

### Manager

Manager is administrator with limited access inside Admin area.

To see all the permissions for Manager role, search for `$roleManager->givePermissionTo` in `RoleAndPermissionSeeder`.

### Blog Manager

This role is created only when Blog module is enabled and has permission to manage blog posts and tags.

Visit `modules/Blog/database/seeders/BlogDatabaseSeeder.php` for more info.
