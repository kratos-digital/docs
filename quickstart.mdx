import { appName } from "/snippets/vars.mdx";

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have installed `PHP 8.3+`, `Node.js 21+`, `Nginx` or `Apache` server, and (optionally) one of the supported database services: `SQLite 3.26+`, `MySQL 5.7+`, `PostgreSQL 10.0+`, `MariaDB 10.3+` or `SQL Server 2017+`.<br />
You should also have `Composer` (dependency manager for PHP) installed.

### Laravel Herd

[Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) is highly recommended local development tool for Laravel. It's very simple to setup and it provides all of the requirements to run **{appName}** (and much more).<br />
It's available for MacOS and Windows.

## Setup

Open your terminal, and run those commands to get started.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kratos-digital-org/butchr-boilerplate.git YOUR_APP_NAME
cd YOUR_APP_NAME
```

### Stay in sync with upstream repo

Use those instructions if you want to keep version control and track future updates in main repository.

#### Check remotes

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see this output:

```bash
origin git@github.com:kratos-digital-org/butchr-boilerplate.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:kratos-digital-org/butchr-boilerplate.git (push)
```

#### Update origin remote

```bash
git remote set-url origin YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY
```

#### Add upstream remote

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:kratos-digital-org/butchr-boilerplate.git
```

#### Verify remotes again

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should now see this output:

```bash
origin YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY (fetch)
origin YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY (push)
upstream git@github.com:kratos-digital-org/butchr-boilerplate.git (fetch)
upstream git@github.com:kratos-digital-org/butchr-boilerplate.git (push)
```

#### Fetch updates from upstream

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

#### Add, commit and push as usual

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push -u origin main # or whatever branch you use
```

### Standalone project

Use those instructions if you want to treat your project as an independent repository without any version control and future updates.

All future updates you will need to handle manually.

#### Remove current git repo

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

#### Initialize a new git repo

```bash
git init
```

#### Commit all files

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

#### Create remote repo

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY
```

#### Push your changes

```bash
git push -u origin main # or whatever branch you use
```

### Create environment file

After you have setup your git repository, continue with the app setup by creating an environment file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Setup database credentials

By default, **{appName}** is using `SQLite` as database connection.

To change database name (default is `database.sqlite`) set the variable in your `.env`. Make sure to enter the absolute path, not just the database name.

```bash
DB_DATABASE="/code/butchr/database/butchr.sqlite"
```

If you want to use the default one (_database.sqlite_), just comment or remove the variable in your .env file

```bash
#DB_DATABASE=
```

To use different database connection, feel free to update the variables accordingly.<br />
This is example for `MySQL` connection, but you can use any of the supported database services.

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=butchr
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### Quick installation

Once you have setup your `.env` file, run this command and follow the steps.

```bash
php artisan app:init
```

<Info>
  Quick installation will run all the commands under Manual setup so you can
  skip the manual setup all together when using quick installation.
</Info>

You will probably want to implement your payment plans, so I recommend to generate your plans right after the installation.

Go to [Generate products](/payments/stripe#generate-products) and follow the docs. You can also visit [Payment settings](/payments/settings) to adjust your checkout pages.

### Manual setup

#### Generate application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

#### Install PHP packages

```bash
composer install
```

#### Install JS packages

```bash
npm ci
```

#### Enable public access to storage folder

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

#### Build CSS and JS

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run local server

<Info>
  If you use Laravel Herd you don't need to run local server since Herd will
  create a local domain for your application.
</Info>

Open new terminal tab or window and start your app.

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and see your application.

<Warning>
  Before using the application, you should run
  [migrations](/development#database) to create your database (and seeders to
  have some data to work with).
</Warning>
