import { appName } from "/snippets/vars.mdx";

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have installed `PHP 8.3+`, `Node.js 21+`, `Nginx` or `Apache` server, and (optionaly) one of the supported database services: `SQLite 3.26+`, `MySQL 5.7+`, `PostgreSQL 10.0+`, `MariaDB 10.3+` or `SQL Server 2017+`.<br />
You should also have `Composer` (dependency manager for PHP) installed.

### Laravel Herd

[Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) is highly recommended local development tool for Laravel. It's very simple to setup and it provides all of the requirements to run **{appName}** (and much more).<br />
It's available for MacOS and Windows.

### Homestead

Instructions coming soon...

### WAMP

Instructions coming soon...

## Setup

Open your terminal, and run those commands to get started.

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:butchr/laravel-starter-kit.git [APP_NAME]
```

### Go to your App folder

```bash
cd [APP_NAME]
```

### Create environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Setup database credentials

By default, **{appName}** is using `SQLite` as database connection.

To change database name (default is `database.sqlite`) set the variable in your `.env`. Make sure to enter the correct path.

```bash
DB_DATABASE="/code/butchr/database/butchr.sqlite"
```

If you want to use the default one, just comment the variable

```bash
#DB_DATABASE=
```

To use different database connection, feel free to update the variables accordingly.<br />
This is example for `MySQL` connection, but you can use any of the supported services.

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=butchr
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### Quick installation

Once you have setup your `.env` file, run this command and follow the steps.

```bash
php artisan app:init
```

<Info>
  Quick installation will run all the commands under Manual setup so you can
  skip the manual setup all together when using quick installation.
</Info>

You will probably implement payments, so I recommend to generate your plans right after installation.

Go to [Generate products](/payments/stripe#generate-products) and follow the docs. You can also visit [Payment settings](/payments/settings) to adjust your checkout pages.

### Manual setup

#### Generate application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

#### Install PHP packages

```bash
composer install
```

#### Install JS packages

```bash
npm ci
```

#### Enable public access to storage folder

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

#### Build CSS and JS

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run local server

<Info>
  If you use Laravel Herd you don't need to run local server since Herd will
  create a local domain for your application.
</Info>

Open new terminal tab or window and start your app.

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and see your application.

<Warning>
  Before using the application, you should run
  [migrations](/development#database) to create your database.
</Warning>
