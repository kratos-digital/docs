import { appName } from "/snippets/vars.mdx";

## Bootstrap

In file `bootstrap/app.php`, you can setup route, global middlewares, redirects, expections, etc.

Usually you will not need to update anything unless you have specific global middlewares, api routes or other global settings.

## Strict mode

By default, **{appName}** enables strict mode for Eloquent Models in non-production environment.

If you want to disable strict mode then go to `AppServiceProvider.php` and delete or comment this line of code.

```php
Model::shouldBeStrict(! $this->app->isProduction());
```

### What is strict mode?

- It prevents lazy loading (n+1 query problem)
- It prevents creating or updating non-fillable attributes (this kit uses `$guarded` instead, so this will not affect anything unless you start using `$fillable` in Models)
- and it prevents accessing missing attributes.

### Why should I use strict mode?

It prevents silent data loss, catches typos early, ensures data integrity, and facilitates debugging, so it's recommended to keep the strict more enabled.

## Polymorphic relationships

When using [polymorphic relationships](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/eloquent-relationships#polymorphic-relationships) in Laravel you must save model name in database along with the ID.

It's good practice to map full class namespaces to readable strings. For example `user` instead of `App\Models\User`.

You can achieve this by enforcing morph map in `AppServiceProvider.php`. Or you can remove to keep using long names.

```php
Relation::enforceMorphMap([
    'admin' => \App\Models\Admin::class,
    'user' => \App\Models\User::class,
]);
```

## Models

As mentioned under Strict mode, **{appName}** uses `$guarded`, instead of the default `$fillable` property for mass assignment.

This prevents having bloated Models and allows seemless dynamic addition of new properties.

Instead, **{appName}** uses Form Requests to pass validated data on create or update of Eloquent Models, so it will never end up with bad data.

Here is an example of simple profile update using Form Request `UpdateProfileRequest`. Only validated data from the request is being passed to the `update()` method. This way we are in a total control of data so no need to explicitly define fillable properties.

```php
public function update(UpdateProfileRequest $request): RedirectResponse
{
    $request->user()->update($request->validated());

    return back();
}
```

If you are more comfortable with fillable properties, you are free to use them. It will not break or affect the app in any way.

Full docs coming soon...

## Validation

By default, **{appName}** uses Form Requests and Policies to validate form data.

You can follow an official Laravel docs on how to generate [Policies](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/authorization#generating-policies) and [Form Requests](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/validation#form-request-validation).

All the predefined core Policies can be found in `/app/Policies` folder, while all the predefined Polices per module can be found under `/modules/{name}/app/Policies` folder.

All the predefined core Form Requests can be found in `/app/Http/Requests` folder, while all the predefined Form Requests per module can be found under `/modules/{name}/app/Http/Requests` folder.

### Authorization

When using form request for validation, you must implement `authorize` method which will allow or prevent further access, based on the rules.

Here you can use Policies or regular conditions.

This is the example from **{appName}** source code to check if users must be authenticated to create Roadmap posts.

```php
public function authorize(): bool
{
    // Guests can't create posts
    if (config('roadmap.must_be_authenticated') && ! $this->user()) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Rules

When using form request for validation, you must implement `rules` method which will define the validation rules.

You can define rules as string where validators are separated with pipe or as array of validators.

[Here](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/validation#available-validation-rules) you can find the list of all available validators.

```php
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'title' => 'required|string|max:120',
        'content' => 'required|string',
    ];
}

public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'title' => [
            'required',
            'string',
            'max:120',
        ],
        'content' => [
            'required',
            'string',
        ],
    ];
}
```

### Messages

When using form request for validation, you can implement `messages` method where you can customize validation messages. By default, validation messages will use `lang/en/validation.php` translation file.

To define the message for your rules you should use this format `rule_name.validator_name`

```php
public function messages(): array
{
    return [
        'title.required' => __('Feature title is required.'),
        'content.required' => __('Feature content is required.'),
    ];
}
```

### Input sanitizer

Package: https://github.com/elegantweb/sanitizer

To use sanitizer in Form Request, you should first use the `SanitizesInput` trait. Then define `filters()` method where you can define [sanitizer rules](https://github.com/elegantweb/sanitizer?tab=readme-ov-file#available-filters) per input field.

```php
public function filters(): array
{
    return [
        // Capitalize the title
        'title' => 'capitalize',
    ];
}
```

Or you can validate and sanitize input in your Controller.

```php
use Elegant\Sanitizer\Sanitizer;

$data = $request->validate([
    'name' => 'required',
    'email' => 'required|email',
]);

$data = (new Sanitizer($data, [
    'name' => 'capitalize',
    'email' => 'lowercase',
]))->sanitize();
```

### Failed authorization

When using form request for validation, you can implement `failedAuthorization` method where you can customize message for failed authorization. By default, validation messages will be "This action is unauthorized".

```php
use Illuminate\Auth\Access\AuthorizationException;

protected function failedAuthorization()
{
    throw new AuthorizationException(__('You are not allowed to do this.'));
}
```

## Shared props

Shared properties are available in every page and component via Inertia `usePage()` method or `$page` variable. Read more about it [here](https://inertiajs.com/shared-data).

### List of props

- **app**: contains common application props such as name, locale, settings, etc.
- **flash**: contains status, description and type of flash message
- **modules**: contains all the enabled modules
- **auth**: contains the data of authenticated user

### Dynamic global props

Pass them via Controller to the view.

- **pageTitle**: main title of the page (also used for tab title and fallback for meta titles)
- **pageDescription**: main description of the page (also used as fallback for meta descriptions)
- **pageUrl**: link to the page (used in `AdminLayout` only)
- **meta**: meta data for SEO, see more [here](/features/seo)

```php
return Inertia::render('Profile/Index', [
    'pageTitle' => __('My profile'),
    'pageDescription' => __('Manage your account information.'),
]);

return Inertia::render('Roadmap::Admin/Show', [
    'pageTitle' => $post->title,
    'pageUrl' => route('roadmap.show', $post->slug),
]);
```

### Example

Here is example how to get authenticated user name from shared props using both:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript usePage()
<script setup lang="ts">
import { computed } from "vue";
import { usePage } from "@inertiajs/vue3";

const user = computed(() => usePage().props.auth.user);
</script>

<template>
  {{ user?.name }}
</template>
```

```javascript $page
<template>
  {{ $page.props.auth.user?.name }}
</template>
```

</CodeGroup>

Go to `HandleInertiaRequests.php`, under `share` method to view and/or update your shared props.

There is also type `PageProps` for shared props in `/resources/js/types/index.d.ts` which you can update accordingly.

### Ziggy

[Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) is package used to enable Laravel routes inside Vue. Routes are also available as shared prop.

Routes are initialized in file `/resources/views/app.blade.php` using the blade rule `@routes`, which uses the settings from this file `/config/ziggy.php`. Feel free to update it by your project requirements.

By default, all routes are available except admin area routes, which are only available once the Admin has logged in.

```php
@if (auth()->guard('admin')->check())
    @routes(['admin'])
@endif
```

## Slugs

[Spatie Sluggable](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-sluggable) is package used to enable slug creation for pretty URLs certain Models like blog posts and tags.

To enable slugs you should use the `Spatie\Sluggable\HasSlug` trait and the `Spatie\Sluggable\SlugOptions` class on your Eloquent Model.

You should also add a field to Model's table where generated slug will be saved.

```php
public function getSlugOptions(): SlugOptions
{
    return SlugOptions::create()
        ->generateSlugsFrom('title')
        ->saveSlugsTo('slug');
}
```

## Media uploads

[Spatie Media Library](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary/v11/introduction) is package used to provide image uploads.

You can update the settings here: `/config/media-library.php`.<br />
Default settings are usually good enough.

To enable image uploads you should implement `Spatie\MediaLibrary\HasMedia` interface and use the `App\Traits\HasMediaUploads` trait on your Eloquent Model.

Then you should register your media collecions and conversions.<br />
The example below creates `cover` media for blog post with `thumbnail` and `small` image.

```php
public function registerMediaCollections(): void
{
    $this
        ->addMediaCollection('cover')
        ->singleFile()
        ->registerMediaConversions(function (Media $media) {
            $this
                ->addMediaConversion('thumb')
                ->fit(Fit::Crop, 150, 150)
                ->nonQueued();

            $this
                ->addMediaConversion('small')
                ->width(640)
                ->nonQueued();
        });
}
```

Then you should upload the image in your Controller or Service/Action.<br />
Method `uploadImage` is defined in the trait `HasMediaUploads` where you can check it's definition.

It accepts three parameters:

- `UploadedFile|string $fileOrPath`: uploaded image file or path to the image
- `string $mediaCollection`: defaults to `cover`
- `string $diskName`: storage disk, defaults to `public`; disks are defined in `config/filesystems.php`

```php
if ($request->image) {
    $post->uploadImage($request->image);
}
```

And finally, this is how you can get the uploaded image URL.<br />

```php
// Get collection cover with original size
$post->getFirstMediaUrl('cover')

// Get collection cover with conversion thumb
$post->getFirstMediaUrl('cover', 'thumb')
```

For additional customization, please, visit the package [docs](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary/v11/introduction).
