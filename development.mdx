## Observers

Full docs coming soon...

## Code formatting

**{appName}** uses [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/pint) for code formatting.

If you prefer to follow same code style then run this command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint
```

## Debugbar

**{appName}** comes with [Debugbar for Laravel](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) so you can debug your application easier and faster.

<Warning>Use the Debugbar only in development.</Warning>

It is disabled by default. To enable it set `DEBUGBAR_ENABLED` to `true` in your `.env`.
