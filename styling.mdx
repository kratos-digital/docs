## Theme

There are several predefined shadcn themes: `resources/css/theme-{color}.css`.

To use one of the themes, update this line: `@import url(theme-neutral.css)` in `app.css`.

### Custom themes

If you need completely custom themes to stand out you can generate custom themes.

There an example of custom generated theme `theme-custom.css` using [shadcn-custom-theme](https://github.com/kiliman/shadcn-custom-theme).

This generator works only with Tailwind colors and you can customize it as you like. If you want to create unique theme with completely custom colors, this generator could be a good start.

Custom theme has been generated using this code:

```bash
npx shadcn-custom-theme primary=orange secondary=green accent=pink gray=neutral
```

Of course, you can always override default colors with your custom colors on specific places. For example, `Card` background color `bg-red-100 dark:bg-red-900` or `Button` `bg-indigo-600`, etc.

## Logo

Recommended way is to update `resources/js/Components/ApplicationLogo.vue` with your own logo SVG.

Make sure to add this `class="fill-current"` to `svg` tag if you have one-colored logo.

You can also upload PNG or SVG image to the `public` folder and use `img` tag instead.

## Favicon

Generate your favicon files and replace them inside `public` folder.

- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico

## Fonts

By default there are two font families included: `Figtree` and `Inter`.

Default font family is `Figtree`. Class for default font family is `font-body`.

If you want to use `Inter` instead, or any other custom font family, update the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
fontFamily: {
    body: ["Inter", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
}
```

If you want to add more fonts, check the [official Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family).

### bunny.net fonts

By default, bunny.net is used to provide the included fonts.

```php
<!-- Fonts -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.bunny.net">
<link href="https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=figtree:400,500,600,700|inter:400,500,600,700" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### Google fonts

To include Google fonts, go to `resources/views/app.blade.php` and similar example instead of the current fonts. Make sure to copy embed code provided by Google, and not the one in example.

```php
<!-- Fonts -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Then update the `tailwind.config.js` accordingly.

### Custom fonts

To use fonts from other providers like Typekit, jsDelivr or Unpkg, just follow their docs and update `app.blade.php` and `tailwind.config.js` accordingly.

If you need help to include custom fonts which are not hosted on any CDN, please, create [Helpdesk ticket](https://butchr.dev/support) in your dashboard.
