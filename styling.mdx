import { appName, appUrl } from "/snippets/vars.mdx";

## Theme

There are several predefined shadcn themes included: `resources/css/theme-{color}.css`.

To use one of the themes, update this line: `@import url(theme-neutral.css)` in `app.css`.

To update default border radius, change the `--radius` value in your theme `css` file.

For example, if you want sharp borders, use this `--radius: 0rem` and if you want round borders, use this `--radius: 1rem`. Default is `--radius: 0.5rem`. You can set any value and see what works best for you.

### Custom themes

If you need completely custom themes to stand out you can generate custom themes.

There an example of custom generated theme `theme-custom.css` using [shadcn-custom-theme](https://github.com/kiliman/shadcn-custom-theme).

This generator works only with Tailwind colors and you can customize it as you like. If you want to create unique theme with completely custom colors, this generator could be a good start.

Custom theme has been generated using this code:

```bash
npx shadcn-custom-theme primary=orange secondary=green accent=pink gray=neutral
```

Of course, you can always override default colors with your custom colors on specific places. For example, `Card` background color `bg-red-100 dark:bg-red-900` or `Button` `bg-indigo-600`, etc.

### TailwindCSS

**{appName}** uses TailwindCSS for styling.

To update default configuration, open `tailwind.config.js` and do the updates.

<Info>
  To override default Tailwind styles, define the properties inside `theme`
  object.
</Info>

```javascript
theme: {
  container: {
    center: true,
    padding: "2rem",
    screens: {
      "2xl": "1536px",
    },
  },
}
```

<Info>
  To extend default Tailwind styles, define the properties inside `theme.extend`
  object.
</Info>

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    screens: {
      "phone-xs": { raw: "(max-width: 389px)" },
      phone: { raw: "(max-width: 639px)" },
    },
  },
}
```

#### Defaults

For some properties you can set the default value to shorten your classes. Just name them as `DEFAULT` in your config.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Colors
// text-primary, bg-primary, border-primary, etc. will use the primary color
// text-primary-foreground, bg-primary-foreground, etc. will use the foreground color
colors: {
  primary: {
    DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--primary))",
    foreground: "hsl(var(--primary-foreground))",
  },
}
```

```javascript Transition duration
// All transition classes will use this duration by default, unless you set one of the available classes for duration
transitionDuration: {
  DEFAULT: "200ms",
}
```

```javascript Transition timing function
// All transition classes will use this timing function by default, unless you set one of the available clasess for timing functions
transitionTimingFunction: {
  DEFAULT: "ease-in-out", // or cubic-bezier value
}
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Safelist

Safelist contains list of classes that should always be included with the build. But don't just safelist any class, use it in situations where classes are dynamically generated and can't be auto-recognized.

```javascript
safelist: ["dark", "backdrop-blur"];
```

## Logo

Recommended way is to update `resources/js/Components/ApplicationLogo.vue` with your own SVG logo.

You can also upload `PNG` or `SVG` image to the `public` folder and use `img` tag instead.

<Warning>
  If you have trouble with the logo display, just create a support ticket and I
  will help you with it.
</Warning>

## Favicon

Generate your favicon files and replace them inside `public` folder.

- android-chrome-192x192.png
- android-chrome-512x512.png
- apple-touch-icon.png
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico

## Fonts

By default there are two font families included: `Figtree` and `Inter`.

Default font family is `Figtree`. Class for default font family is `font-body`.

If you want to use `Inter` instead, or any other custom font family, update the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
fontFamily: {
    body: ["Inter", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
}
```

If you want to add more fonts, check the [official Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family).

### bunny.net fonts

By default, bunny.net is used to provide the included fonts.

```php
<!-- Fonts -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.bunny.net">
<link href="https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=figtree:400,500,600,700|inter:400,500,600,700" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### Google fonts

To include Google fonts, go to `resources/views/app.blade.php` and similar example instead of the current fonts. Make sure to copy embed code provided by Google, and not the one in example.

```php
<!-- Fonts -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Then update the `tailwind.config.js` accordingly.

### Custom fonts

To use fonts from other providers like Typekit, jsDelivr or Unpkg, just follow their docs and update `app.blade.php` and `tailwind.config.js` accordingly.

If you need help to include custom fonts which are not hosted on any CDN, please, create [Helpdesk ticket](https://butchr.dev/helpdesk) in your dashboard.

## Typography

To style HTML coming from editor **{appName}** uses `@tailwindcss/typography` package and its prose classes.

You can style it under `typography` in `tailwind.config.js` configuration file and in `resources/css/app.css` using `.prose` class (there are already some custom styles included).

### Links

There are two predefined styles for anchor tags (links).

```css
.inline-link {
  @apply underline underline-offset-4 transition hover:text-primary;
}

.inline-link-v2 {
  @apply underline underline-offset-4 transition hover:no-underline;
}
```

```html
<template>
  <a href="#link" class="inline-link">Link</a>
  <Link href="#link" class="inline-link-v2">Link</Link>
</template>
```

### Text highlight

By default, text highlight will be in combination of background and foreground colors.

To update this, go to `resources/css/app.css` and update `selection:bg-foreground` and `selection:text-background`.

```css
body {
  @apply selection:bg-foreground selection:text-background;
}
```

## Icons

Default icons used across the application are [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) icons.

You can import them like this in your script setup:

```javascript
import {
  CrownIcon,
  SwordsIcon,
  GemIcon,
  PackageIcon,
  CreditCardIcon,
  UsersIcon,
  ShieldCheckIcon,
  MessageSquareMoreIcon,
  BotIcon,
} from "lucide-vue-next";
```

And use them like this in your template:

```javascript
<CrownIcon class="size-4" />
<SwordsIcon class="size-6 text-primary" />
```

### Social icons

Since Lucide doesn't provide icons for social media providers, they are custom-generated using [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/).

To check which icons are available with **{appName}**, how to use them and how to add new icons, go to [this page](/components/extras/icons).
