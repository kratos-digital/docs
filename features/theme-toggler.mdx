import { appName } from "/snippets/vars.mdx";

`resources/js/Components/ThemeToggle.vue`

**{appName}** comes with configured light and dark modes.

Default mode is set to `auto` which will respect user's browser preferences.

If you want to set default mode to light or dark, set `VITE_THEME_MODE` in your `.env` file to `light` or `dark`.

<Note>
  When you change the THEME_MODE, clear the local storage to apply the changes
  for your browser.
</Note>

To clear your local storage, open your Console and type this:

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
```

Theme toggler is already included in main menu, but you can update the default style to dropdown:

```javascript
withDefaults(
  defineProps<{
    display?: "toggle" | "dropdown";
  }>(),
  {
    display: "dropdown", // Change default value from toggle to dropdown
  },
);
```

Or for specific component, while keeping _toggle_ as default:

```javascript
<ThemeToggle display="dropdown" />
```
