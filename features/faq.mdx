## Intro

By default there are 10 randomly generated FAQ posts for Demo purposes. You should update them in `FaqSeeder.php` or disable the seeder by removing it from `DatabaseSeeder.php`.

When creating FAQs via seeder, you need to provide those attributes:

- **title**: Question.
- **content**: Answer.
- **created_at**: Optional. Defaults to current datetime.
- **updated_at**: Optional. Defaults to current datetime.

```php
Faq::create([
    'title' => 'Question 1?',
    'content' => 'Answer 1...',
]);

Faq::create([
    'title' => 'Question 2?',
    'content' => 'Answer 2...',
]);
```

## Admin

Administrators with correct permissions can manage FAQ via admin panel.
