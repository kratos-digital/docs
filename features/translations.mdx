import { appName } from "/snippets/vars.mdx";

**{appName}** uses Laravel's default localization setup documented [here](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/localization).

Translations for base application are located in `/lang` folder as `en.json` and `php` translation files inside `/lang/en` folder.

If default locale for your application is not english, you can rename them and translate the strings.

If your application should be multilingual, you can follow the official documentation how to setup such behavior, or you can install composer packages to handle such cases.

<Info>
  Option to use multiple languages with language switcher will be one of the
  features in **{appName}** version 2.

# How to use

You can save translations as [short keys](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/localization#using-short-keys) or as [translation strings](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/localization#using-translation-strings-as-keys).

To render translations in backend, you can do this:

```php
// auth.php file, it looks for login key, and then looks for title key under login
// This will output "Sign in" or however your define your translation
$translationKey = __('auth.login.title');

// This will output as-is
$translationString = __('This is some string');
```

To render translations on frontend, you can do this:

```javascript
<script setup lang="ts">
import { trans, wTrans } from "laravel-vue-i18n";

console.log(trans("Foo"), wTrans("Bar"));
</script>

<template>
    <p>{{ $t("auth.login.title") }}</p>
    <p>{{ $t("This is some string") }}</p>
</template>
```

<Info>
  Those basics should be enough, but if you require an advanced implementation
  you can check the plugin [Laravel Vue
  i18n](https://github.com/xiCO2k/laravel-vue-i18n) used to provide Laravel
  translations to Vue files.
