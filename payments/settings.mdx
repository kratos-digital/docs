## Intro

To set payment provider other than Stripe, define `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` variable in your `.env`.

<Info>
  Default and currently only supported payment provider is **Stripe**.
</Info>

## One-time payments

To use one-time payments set `PAYMENT_PRODUCTS_TYPE` to `single` in your `.env`.<br />

## Subscriptions

To use one-time payments set `PAYMENT_PRODUCTS_TYPE` to `recurring` in your `.env`.<br />
This is the default setup.

### Trial

To enable trial periods set `PAYMENT_TRIAL_DAYS` to number of days.

## Currency

Default currency is set to `USD`.

To update default currency for your plans and application, go to `.env` file and update this variable:

```bash
CASHIER_CURRENCY='eur'
```

<Warning>Currency must be defined with lowercased ISO 4217 code.</Warning>

### Format

Default currency format is `en_US`.

To update default currency format, go to `.env` file:

```bash
CASHIER_CURRENCY_LOCALE=de_DE
```

```php
// Formatting using en_US:
// $1,000.00
// €500.00
// £19.99

// Formatting using de_DE:
// 1.000,00 $
// 500,00 €
// 19,99 £

// Formatting using nl_BE:
// US$ 1.000,00
// € 500,00
// £ 19,99
```

## Highlighted plan

If you want to highlight specific plan, for example the best value plan, set `PAYMENT_HIGHLIGHTED_PRODUCT_ID` to the ID of the plan.

## Cache

Some payment data, like products and coupons, is cached upon update. Cache keys are defined in `config/payments.php` under `settings.cache_keys`. Feel free to update those keys as you wish.

To delete data from cache manually you can call this command in your terminal:

```bash
php artisan cache:forget payment_products
php artisan cache:forget payment_coupons
```

## Authenticated payments

When using one-time payments you can allow your users to buy products without registering their account.

To enable this set `PAYMENT_MUST_BE_AUTHENTICATED` to `false`.

<Warning>Subscriptions require user authentication.</Warning>

## Address

To enforce address calculation at checkout set `PAYMENT_COLLECT_ADDRESS` to `true`.

## Taxes

To enable tax calculation at checkout set `PAYMENT_CALCULATE_TAXES` to `true`.

### Tax IDs

To disable customer tax IDs at checkout set `PAYMENT_COLLECT_TAX_IDS` to `false`.

Enabled by default.

## Discounts

To disable discount and coupons at checkout set `PAYMENT_ALLOW_DISCOUNTS` to `false`.

Enabled by default.

### Coupons

To create a coupon go to [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), click **Product catalog** in sidebar, and then click **Coupons** in subnav, and then click **Create coupon** button.

There you can set information about a percent-off or amount-off discount you might want to apply to a product, limitations, expiration, etc.

To apply coupons to products, run this command and follow the prompts:

```bash
php artisan payments:coupon
```

You can apply different coupon to different product, or use single coupon for all products.

<Warning>
  Applied coupons reduce the price and cannot be removed during checkout by
  user. This is the Stripe feature.
</Warning>

To remove applied coupons from your products, run this command:

```bash
php artisan payments:remove-coupons
```

### Promotion codes

To create a promotion code go to [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), click **Product catalog** in sidebar, then click **Coupons** in subnav, then create or select an existing coupon.

On coupon page, look for Promotion Codes section and create new promotion codes for this coupon.

Promotion Code represents a customer-redeemable code for a coupon.

You can also apply promotion codes to your products using the same artisan command.

<Info>
  To apply a promo code, you must use promotion code ID (*API ID*), not code
  (*Promotion code*).
</Info>

<Info>Customers must apply the code (*30*), and not ID (*promo_1Q5p...*).</Info>

## Free trials

To enable free trials set `PAYMENT_TRIAL_DAYS` to the number of days.

```bash
PAYMENT_TRIAL_DAYS=3
```

<Warning>Free trials work only with subscriptions.</Warning>

### Without payment method up front

If you would like to offer trial periods without collecting the user's payment method information up front, you may set the `trial_ends_at` column on the user record to your desired trial ending date.

This is typically done during user registration:

```php
$user = User::create([
  // ...
  'trial_ends_at' => now()->addDays(3),
]);
```

## Check if subscribed

To check if user is subscribed you can use middleware `subscribed` defined here `app/Http/Middleware/Subscribed.php`.

This will check if user has any purchased product when using single payments or valid subscription when using recurring payments.

```php
Route::middleware(['subscribed'])->group(function () {
  Route::get('/secret-page', fn () => dd('You are subscribed'));
});
```

You can also check if user is subscribed to specific price or product:

```php
Route::middleware(['subscribed:some_price_id'])->group(function () {
  Route::get('/secret-page', fn () => dd('You are subscribed to this price'));
});

Route::middleware(['subscribed:some_product_id'])->group(function () {
  Route::get('/secret-page', fn () => dd('You are subscribed to this product'));
});
```

<Info>
  Unsubscribed users will be redirected and shown a corresponding toast
  notification.
