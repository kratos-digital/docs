## Email providers

### Local / Testing

#### Mailtrap

I personally use Mailtrap for emails in local environment, so it's my recommendation. This doesn't mean other services mentioned below are worse or better in any way.

https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/mail#mailtrap

1. Create and setup [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) account
2. Update `.env` file with Mailtrap credentials

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your-mailtrap-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-mailtrap-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@example.com"
```

#### HELO

Coming soon...

#### Mailpit

Coming soon...

### Production / Staging

**{appName}** doesn't come with any pre-installed email service since there is not one that fits all cases, and it's actually very easy to setup any of the services mentioned below.

To implement desired mail service, just follow the instructions below or [official Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/mail#driver-prerequisites).

#### Mailgun

Coming soon...

#### Postmark

Coming soon...

#### Resend

Coming soon...

#### MailerSend

1. Install the package:

```bash
composer require mailersend/laravel-driver
```

2. Create a [MailerSend](https://www.mailersend.com/signup) account.

Once your are logged in, go to Email - Domains to add your domain. You should also approve your account to avoid limitations.

3. Go to Integrations and create API token for your domain. Update your `.env` file:

```bash
MAIL_MAILER=mailersend
MAILERSEND_API_KEY=your-api-key
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=app@yourdomain.com
```

4. Add MailerSend to `config/mail.php` configuration file inside `mailers` array:

```php
'mailersend' => [
    'transport' => 'mailersend',
],
```

#### Custom

https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/mail#custom-transports

## Queue emails

All emails are sent using Laravel's [deferred functions](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/helpers#deferred-functions). If you need to send large amount of emails it's recommended to send them in queues.

### Setup local queue

https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/mail#queueing-mail

Docs coming soon...

### Setup queue worker

Docs coming soon...

### Laravel Horizon

Docs coming soon...

## Previews emails

You can preview emails in local environment.

Preview routes are defined in `routes/emails.php` route file.

Here is the list of all email preview routes (each route is prefixed with `/email-previews`):

- `/email-verification` Email sent upon user registration (when email verification is enabled)
- `/password-reset` Email sent upon password reset request
- `/subscribed` Email sent upon successful subscription

## Email templates

Default emails are rendered using markdown files located in `resources/views/mail` folder.

Main message layout: `resources/views/vendor/mail/html/message.blade.php`

```php
// Default title "Hello!"
<x-mail::message>
    // Mail content here
</x-mail::message>

// Custom title
<x-mail::message :title="$title">
    // Mail content here
</x-mail::message>

// If no title and user model is provider, the title will be "Hello, :name!" where name is user's name
// You can also pass url and action text, which will display subcopy in cases where button is not rendered
<x-mail::message :user="$user" :url="$url" :action-text="$actionText">
    // Mail content here
</x-mail::message>
```

List of all components used in email templates are located in `resources/views/vendor/mail/html` folder:

- layout: Main HTML file to render email template. You should probably leave this as-is.
- header: Application name with link to website, positioned above the content. You can update it to show your logo or anything relevant.
- footer: Copyright text below the content.
- panel: Highlighted text block.
- table: Table block.
- button: Action button. Accepts three parameters: **color**: primary (default), blue, green/success, red/error; **url** and **align**: left, right, center (default). You can add custom colors to _default.css_ `button-{color_name}`

```php
<x-mail::button color="green" :url="$url" align="left">
    @lang('Click me')
</x-mail::button>
```

- subcopy: Smaller text used as disclaimer.
- salutation: Included in message component.

To change style, you can update `resources/views/vendor/mail/html/themes/default.css` CSS file.
