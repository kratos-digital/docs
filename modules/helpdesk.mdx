## Introduction

Default Helpdesk module comes with tickets, comments (per ticket) and support level. You can update support levels in this enum `modules/Helpdesk/app/Enums/HelpdeskSupportLevel.php`. You can also update enums for ticket status (open, in progress, resolved) and ticket type (general questions, tech support, billing inquiry, bug report).

## Enable/disable module

### Via terminal

```bash
php artisan module:enable Helpdesk
```

```bash
php artisan module:disable Helpdesk
```

### Manually

`modules_statuses.json`

Set Helpdesk to `true` (enabled) or `false` (disabled)

## Override files

To override tables for database, you can either update original migration file in `modules/Helpdesk/database/migrations` folder or publish migrations to your application's `migrations` folder.

```bash
php artisan module:publish-migration helpdesk
```

To override templates, publish them using this command. Files will be copied to `resources/js/Modules/Helpdesk` folder where you can update them as you wish.

```bash
php artisan app:publish-module-view helpdesk
```

Upon calling this command you will be prompted to copy files for admin area, which is disabled by default.

<Warning>
  It's recommended to publish files if you need to update anything.
</Warning>

## Support level for Users

By default, all registered users will be set to expired. Users with expired support level are not allowed to create new tickets or comment on existing tickets.

If you plan to use this module it's recommended to set support level for your users upon successful subscription, order, registration or some other event in your application.

User model implements `modules/Helpdesk/app/Traits/HasSupport.php` trait so you can use this line of code to assign desired support level to the user:

```php
use Modules\Helpdesk\Enums\HelpdeskSupportLevel;

$user->setSupportLevel(HelpdeskSupportLevel::Premium);
```

<Note>
  If you updated the `HelpdeskSupportLevel` enum, update the `HasSupport` trait
  accordingly to avoid bugs.
</Note>

### Get current support level

```php
$level = $user->support_level;
```

### Query users with support

```php
// Get all users with active support
User::hasSupport()->get();

// Count all users with active support
User::hasSupport()->count();

// Get all users with expired support
User::hasNoSupport()->get();
```

### Check if user has active support

```php
if ($user->hasAnySupport()) {
    // Has active support
}

if (! $user->hasAnySupport()) {
    // No support
}
```

### Check if user has premium support

```php
if ($user->hasPremiumSupport()) {
    // Has premium support
}
```
