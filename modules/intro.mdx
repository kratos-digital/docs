## Migrations

To override tables for database, you can either update original migration file in `modules/Blog/database/migrations` folder or publish migrations to your application's `migrations` folder.

It's recommended to publish them if you need to make any updates. If you will use the default database, you don't need to do anything, other than publishing the module and running migrate command.

```bash
php artisan module:publish-migration
```

This command will trigger a prompt to select which model's migrations you wish to publish. You can select all or specify which ones. You can also run this command for each module, but for this check the docs for those specific modules.
