php artisan module:enable Blog
```

```bash
php artisan module:disable Blog
```

## Style

To update hover style, search for `group-hover/article` and update it as you wish.

### Background on hover

By default, blog post cards have subtle background color beneath the card's content on hover.

Image coming soon...

To remove this background go to `resources/js/Components/Article/ArticleCard.vue` and remove all classes with `before:` keyword.

### Background on single page

Blog post page has included subtle background color benath the post header.

Go to `modules/Blog/resources/js/Pages/Show.vue` and update it as you wish. If you want to remove the background just delete the entire class on `SectionWrapper`.

## Share post

Every blog post has included **share** functionality, where you can copy the post link or share it on **X**, **Facebook** and **LinkedIn**, by default.

To remove sharing or update available platforms, go to `modules/Blog/resources/js/Pages/Show.vue` and update `SocialMediaShare enum` and `shareOnSocialMedia` function.
