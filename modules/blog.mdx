## Introduction

Default Blog module comes with posts and tags.

## Enable/disable module

### Via terminal

```bash
php artisan module:enable Blog
```

```bash
php artisan module:disable Blog
```

### Manually

`modules_statuses.json`

Set Blog to `true` (enabled) or `false` (disabled)

## Override files

To override tables for database, you can either update original migration file in `modules/Blog/database/migrations` folder or publish migrations to your application's `migrations` folder.

```bash
php artisan module:publish-migration blog
```

To override templates, publish them using this command. Files will be copied to `resources/js/Modules/Blog` folder where you can update them as you wish.

```bash
php artisan app:publish-module-view blog
```

Upon calling this command you will be prompted to copy files for admin area, which is disabled by default.

<Warning>
  It's recommended to publish files if you need to update anything.
</Warning>

## Configuration

Go to dedicated `config` file and update the settings to fit your application.

### Posts per page

Default is `12`

Set `posts_per_page` to any integer to define how many posts will be shown per page. At the moment, posts are paginated by classic pagination. There will be pagination on scroll (aka infinite load) in future updates.

## Style

To update hover style, search for `group-hover/article` and update it as you wish.

### Background on hover

By default, blog post cards have subtle background color beneath the card's content on hover.

To remove this background go to `resources/js/Components/Article/ArticleCard.vue` and remove all classes with `before:` keyword.

### Background on single page

Blog post page has included subtle background color benath the post header.

Go to `modules/Blog/resources/js/Pages/Show.vue` and update it as you wish. If you want to remove the background just delete the entire class on `SectionWrapper`.

## Share post

Every blog post has included **share** functionality, where you can copy the post link or share it on **X**, **Facebook** and **LinkedIn**, by default.

To remove sharing or update available platforms, go to `modules/Blog/resources/js/Pages/Show.vue` and update `SocialMediaShare enum` and `shareOnSocialMedia` function.
