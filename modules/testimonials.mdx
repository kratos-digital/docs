To override tables for database, you can either update original migration file in `modules/Testimonials/database/migrations` folder or publish migrations to your application's `migrations` folder.

php artisan module:publish-migration testimonials
```

To override templates, publish them using this command. Files will be copied to `resources/js/Modules/Testimonials` folder where you can update them as you wish.

php artisan app:publish-module-view testimonials
```

Upon calling this command you will be prompted to copy files for admin area, which is disabled by default.
