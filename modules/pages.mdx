## Intro

By default there are 4 pre-defined pages which you can update in `PageSeeder.php`:

- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- Cookie Policy
- Licenses

When creating page via seeder, you need to provide required attributes (combination of `route_name` and `group` attributes must be unique):

- **title**: Page title.
- **url_path**: Unique. URL path of the page.
- **route_name**: Route name (Laravel named routes).
- **content**: HTML content of the page.
- **group**: Optional. Defaults to `legal`. Does not affect the URL.

If you want to use other groups, for example `about`, first you need to add them as enum in `app/Enums/PageGroup.php`:

```php
enum PageGroup: string
{
    case Legal = 'legal';
    case About = 'about';
}
```

```php
// This will create "Privacy Policy" page with "/privacy-policy" URL and "legal.privacy" route name
Page::create([
    'title' => 'Privacy Policy',
    'url_path' => 'privacy-policy',
    'route_name' => 'privacy',
    'content' => '<p>Privacy Policy content...</p>',
]);

// This will create "About" page with "/about" URL and "about.index" route name
Page::create([
    'title' => 'About',
    'url_path' => 'about',
    'route_name' => 'index',
    'group' => PageGroup::About,
    'content' => '<p>About content...</p>',
]);
```

## Admin

Administrators with correct permissions can manage Pages via admin panel.
