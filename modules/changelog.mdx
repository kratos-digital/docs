## Enable/disable module

### Via terminal

```bash
php artisan module:enable Changelog
```

```bash
php artisan module:disable Changelog
```

### Manually

`modules_statuses.json`

Set Changelog to `true` (enabled) or `false` (disabled)

## Override files

To override tables for database, you can either update original migration file in `modules/Changelog/database/migrations` folder or publish migrations to your application's `migrations` folder.

```bash
php artisan module:publish-migration changelog
```

To override templates, publish them using this command. Files will be copied to `resources/js/Modules/Changelog` folder where you can update them as you wish.

```bash
php artisan app:publish-module-view changelog
```

Upon calling this command you will be prompted to copy files for admin area, which is disabled by default.

<Warning>
  It's recommended to publish files if you need to update anything.
