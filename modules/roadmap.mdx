## Introduction

Display the list of user-requested features, approved, in progress, resolved and rejected ones.

Users can also upvote and/or downvote features and add comments to features.

## Enable/disable module

Each module can be enabled or disabled in your application, without affecting other parts of your code.

### Via terminal

```bash
php artisan module:enable Roadmap
```

```bash
php artisan module:disable Roadmap
```

### Manually

`modules_statuses.json`

Set Roadmap to `true` (enabled) or `false` (disabled).

## Override files

To override tables for database, you can either update original migration file in `modules/Roadmap/database/migrations` folder or publish migrations to your application's `migrations` folder.

```bash
php artisan module:publish-migration roadmap
```

To override templates, publish them using this command. Files will be copied to `resources/js/Modules/Roadmap` folder where you can update them as you wish.

```bash
php artisan app:publish-module-view roadmap
```

Upon calling this command you will be prompted to copy files for admin area, which is disabled by default.

<Warning>
  It's recommended to publish files if you need to update anything.
</Warning>

## Configuration

Go to dedicated `config` file and update the settings to fit your application.

### Author can vote

Default is `true`

Set `author_can_vote` to `true` to allow authors to upvote their own features.

Set `author_can_vote` to `false` to prevent authors to upvote their own features.

### Downvotes

Default is `true`

Set `downvotes_enabled` to `true` to enable downvotes.

Set `downvotes_enabled` to `false` to disable downvotes.

### Authenticated

Default is `true`

Set `must_be_authenticated` to `true` to allow creation of new features only for authenticated users.

Set `must_be_authenticated` to `false` to allow guests (non-authenticated users) to create new features.

### Subscribed

Default is `false`

Set `must_be_subscribed` to `true` to allow creation of new features and comments only for subscribed users.

When `true` the `must_be_authenticated` value will be ignored since subscribed users must be authenticated to get correct data.
