## Introduction

Display the list of user-requested features, approved, in progress, resolved and rejected ones.

Users can also upvote and/or downvote features and add comments to features.

## Enable/disable module

Each module can be enabled or disabled in your application, without affecting other parts of your code.

### Terminal

```bash
php artisan module:enable Roadmap
```

```bash
php artisan module:disable Roadmap
```

### Manually

`modules_statuses.json`

Set Roadmap to `true` (enabled) or `false` (disabled).

## Configuration

Open this file `modules/Roadmap/config/config.php` and update Roadmap settings to fit your application.

### Author can vote

Default is `true`

Set `author_can_vote` to `true` to allow authors to upvote their own features.

Set `author_can_vote` to `false` to prevent authors to upvote their own features.

### Downvotes

Default is `true`

Set `downvotes_enabled` to `true` to enable downvotes.

Set `downvotes_enabled` to `false` to disable downvotes.

### Authenticated

Default is `true`

Set `must_be_authenticated` to `true` to allow creation of new features only for authenticated users.

Set `must_be_authenticated` to `false` to allow guests (non-authenticated users) to create new features.

### Subscribed

Default is `false`

Set `must_be_subscribed` to `true` to allow creation of new features and comments only for subscribed users.

When `true` the `must_be_authenticated` value will be ignored since subscribed users must be authenticated to get correct data.
