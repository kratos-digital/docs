`resources/js/Components/DataTable/Index.vue`

Package: [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest)

## Introduction

**{appName}** comes with built-in DataTable module built upon TanStack Table.

Available features:

- Data from query builder (Laravel Eloquent)
- Row actions (CRUD and custom actions)
- Sorting, pagination and search
- Filtering
- Render as badge and as status
- Light and dark modes
- Easy to customize
- Bulk actions (coming soon)
- Export to CSV and PDF (coming soon)

To generate DataTable, you should first render `Vue` file component using `Inertia::render()` from your Controller.

Properties `data` and `columns` are required, while `filters` prop is optional.

```php UserController.php
public function index(): Response
{
    return Inertia::render('Admin/Users/Index', [
        'data' => User::get(),
        'columns' => [
            Column::make('id'),
            Column::make('name'),
            Column::make('email'),
            ActionColumn::make(route: 'admin.users')->render(),
        ],
    ]);
}
```

Then in your file component, for example in `Admin/Users/Index`, define the props (using `DataTableProps` type) and render the `DataTable` component.

```javascript
<script setup lang="ts">
import { DataTable as DataTableProps } from "@/types";

const props = defineProps<DataTableProps>();
</script>

<template>
    <DataTable v-bind="props" />
</template>
```

## Columns

Go to `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php`, or any similar Controller, and check out `index` method to see how columns are generated.

Columns are generated via `Column::class`, as seen in the code example above.<br />
Each column should be generated using `make` method. All other methods are optional.

### Create column

First prop is name/ID of the column and should be unique between columns.<br />
Second prop is column's title (table head) and it's optional.<br />
When title is not provided, it will be generated from name/ID.<br />.
For example, auto-generated title for `name` column will be _Name_, for `email` will be _Email_, and so on.

```php
Column::make('name', __('Full name'))
```

### Disable sorting

Columns are sortable by default. Chain this method to disable sorting for the column.

```php
Column::make('name')->disableSorting()
```

### Disable hiding

Column visibility toggle is enabled by default. Visiblity toggle for this column will be disabled and column will be always visible.

```php
Column::make('name')->disableHiding()
```

### Status (true/false)

Render column as `check` icon for `true` and `x` icon for `false`.

```php
Column::make('verified')->status()
```

### Badge

Render column as badge.

```php
Column::make('tags')->badge()
```

### Thumbnail

Render column as thumbnail image.

```php
Column::make('image')->thumbnail()
```

### Class

Add class to the value cell.

If class is not generated, safelist it, since it’s dynamically generated and Tailwind can’t recognize such classes on its own.<br />
Just in case, you can safelist all clasess you plan to use here.

You can safelist classes in `tailwind.config.js` under `safelist` array.

```php
Column::make('name')->class('font-bold whitespace-nowrap')
Column::make('email')->class('truncate max-w-16')
```

### Cell width

Set width of the cell in pixels to prevent auto-sizing or specific width.

Size equal to 1 will make cell's width as minimum as possible.

```php
Column::make('name')->size(1)
```

### Center

Center table header and value.

```php
Column::make('name')->centered()
```

### Make column hidden

Useful when you need to filter by some value, but don't want to show the column. For example, when Model is trashed (soft-deleted).<br />
Since filtering is done via TanStack Table it should have access to the data.

```php
Column::make('trashed')->hidden()
```

### Customize

To update content rendering in DataTables go to file `resources/js/lib/utils.ts` and update function `mapColumns` as you wish.

You can check by `accessorKey` (which is mapped from column name/ID) for specific columns, or you can define new `renderAs` method for common columns.

Some of specifically rendered columns are `id` `session_id` `thumb` `badge` and `status`.

To update or add Column properties go to file `app/Services/DataTable/Column.php`.

## Actions

Actions should be defined as the last item in `columns` array.<br />
Actions are generated similar as columns, using chained methods.

### Create action

First prop is column name and should be unique between actions.<br />
Second prop is the action's label, and it's optional<br />
When label is not provided, it will be generated from name. Label for `show` will be _Show_, for `edit` will be _Edit_, etc.

```php
Action::make('show', __('Show order'))
    ->route('admin.orders.show')
```

### Action route

Set the route name of the action. By default, routes should be GET and will use model ID as param.

```php
Action::make('name')->route('admin.orders.show')
```

### Method and params

Set the route method and params when method is different than GET and there is multiple params or different params than ID.

```php
Action::make('resolve')
    ->route('admin.roadmap.status.update')
    ->method('patch')
    ->params([
        // placeholder to use prop from column (:id will use column id value, :name will use column name value, etc.)
        'post' => ':id',
        // extra param to update status of roadmap post in this specific case
        'status' => 'resolved',
    ])
```

### Confirm dialog

Trigger confirmation dialog before submitting the action.

Default actions `delete` and `restore` are confirmable by default.

```php
Action::make('impersonate', __('Login as user'))->confirm()
```

### Conditional actions

Show action under specified condition.<br />
This action will be available only when `trashed` column value is `false`.

```php
Action::make('impersonate', __('Login as user'))->when('trashed', false)
```

### Separate actions (in dropdown view)

Separate action with border in dropdown box.

```php
Action::make('name')->separated()
```

### Dropdown actions

Actions can be rendered as dropdown.

Dropdown actions are recommended when there are **more than 3 actions**.<br />
Check the code below to see how to render dropdown actions.<br />

### Inline actions

Actions can also be rendered as inline, instead of dropdown.

Inline actions are recommended when there are **less than 3 actions**.<br />
Check the code below to see how to render dropdown actions.<br />

### Default actions

Each DataTable comes with default actions which you can use along the custom ones or completely override. Default actions are `show`, `edit`, `delete` and `restore` (when Model can be [soft-deleted](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/eloquent#soft-deleting)).

If you need to update your default actions, you can do it here: `app/Services/DataTable/ActionColumn.php` in method `private function getDefaults(): array`.

#### Render as dropdown

`make()` method accepts two optional parameters: `renderAs` and `route`.<br />
When renderAs is null it will be rendered as dropdown.<br />
When route is null you should define [custom actions](/modules/datatable#custom-actions).

You should set the **route prefix** for default actions. For example, if you are using resource controller, then the actions will be: _admin.users.show_, _admin.users.edit_, etc. and it's recommended way to name your CRUD routes in this way even when not using resource controller.

```php
ActionColumn::make(route: 'admin.users')->render()
```

#### Render as inline

You should set the **route prefix** for default actions. For example, if you are using resource controller, then the actions will be: _admin.users.show_, _admin.users.edit_, etc.

```php
ActionColumn::make('inline', 'admin.users')->render()
```

### Custom actions

To define custom actions, you should pass your actions in `render()` method of 1.

```php
ActionColumn::make('inline')
    ->render(
        Action::make('show')
            ->route('admin.orders.show'),

        Action::make('edit')
            ->route('admin.orders.edit'),
    ),
```

### Custom actions via slots

To define custom actions via Vue slot, you should define the type of actions: inline or dropdown, without the route prop.

Rendering actions via slots is useful when you want customized UI for your actions, for example to open dialogs/popups/sheets for editing, instead of dedicated pages.

```php
// Dropdown
ActionColumn::make()->render(),

// Inline
ActionColumn::make('inline')->render(),
```

And then define your actions in Vue file.

```javascript
<template v-slot:actions="{ row }">
    <Button type="button" variant="link" @click="() => console.log('Edit')">{{ $t("Edit") }}</Button>
    <Button type="button" variant="link" class="text-destructive" @click="() => console.log('Delete')">{{ $t("Delete") }}</Button>
</template>
```

`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/FaqController.php` is using such custom actions.<br />
Slot example for custom FAQ actions can be found here: `resources/js/Pages/Admin/Faq/Index.vue`

## Filters

Filter key must be equal to the column name/ID, so in this case you should have columns `verified`, `blocked` and `trashed`.

Create filter using `make()` method which accepts one prop for filter title.

```php
'filters' => [
    'verified' => Filter::make(__('Email verified'))
        ->trueFalse(true),

    'blocked' => Filter::make(__('Blocked'))
        ->trueFalse(false),

    'trashed' => Filter::make(__('Trashed'))
        ->trueFalse(false),
],
```

### Status (true/false)

Filter DataTable by true and false value.

```php
// Without default fitering
Filter::make(__('Email verified'))->trueFalse()

// Filter by true on init
Filter::make(__('Email verified'))->trueFalse(true)

// Filter by false on init
Filter::make(__('Email verified'))->trueFalse(false)
```

### Value

Filter DataTable by selected values.

Data of available filters should be [Collection](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/collections) or array of arrays with `value` and `label` props.

```php
$tags = Tag::get()->map(fn ($tag) => [
    'value' => $tag->slug,
    'label' => $tag->name,
]);

Filter::make(__('Tags'))->data($tags)
```

### Disable search

By default, all filters can be searched and filtered inside dedicated dropdown.

To disable search, use this method. Disabling search is recommended when there are few filters so search would be redundant.

```php
Filter::make(__('Tags'))->data($tags)->disableSearch()
```

### Pre-selected filters

Similar as with true/false, you can set default filters.

Default value can be an array, string or boolean.

```php
// This example is taken from Helpdesk to filter tickets by currently logged in admin and all unassigned tickets
Filter::make(__('Admins'))->data($admins)->default([auth()->user()->name, __('Unassigned')])
```

## Search

## Pagination

Each datatable comes with default pagination which shows **10** rows per page and you can select to show _10_, _20_ , _30_, _40_, _50_ or _100_ rows at once when viewing the data.

To change global defaults go to `resources/js/Components/DataTable/Index.vue` file and update default values for `rowsPerPage` and `pageSize` props.

To update defaults for specific datatable you can pass those props via controller:

```php
return Inertia::render('SomePageWithDataTable', [
    // other props here
    'rowsPerPage' => [5, 10, 20],
    'pageSize' => 5,
]);
```

This will set select options to _5_, _10_ and _20_, and **5** rows per page by default.

You can find sample code in `AdminTestimonialController.php` controller file.
